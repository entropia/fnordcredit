# fnordcredit-entropia
Open source credit system with entropia flavour

Innovative, easy to use credit system for multiple users that comes with an intuitive design: Create an account and charge or discharge your credit.

## Development
fnordcredit is written in Javascript/Node.js/jQuery/rethinkDB.

To start a local development server, have rethinkDB installed and running, then do the following:

	git clone git@github.com:entropia/fnordcredit.git
	cd fnordcredit
	npm install
	cp config.js.example config.js
	node tools/dbInit.js

As last step, start the local development server using ```npm start``` and point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000.

	--name fnordcredit-rethinkdb \
	--network fnordcredit \
	-v /srv/fnordcredit/db:/data \
